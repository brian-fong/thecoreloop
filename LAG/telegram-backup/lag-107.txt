‼️ SPECIAL INSIGHTS 👀
powered by AppMagic.rocks 😎

The Collectible Card Games (CCG) genre generated $550M and 86M downloads in 2022.  The Eastern tier-1 markets generated $361M and the Western tier-1 markets accounted for $145M.  

The top 5 games in the western markets for 2022 so far are WWE SuperCard, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links, Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel, with MARVEL SNAP in 7th place all totalling $106.3M — basically 66% of the western tier-1 markets.  

The concentration in the top games in CCG is driven largely by IP and is definitely a winners-take-most market structure.
