But some parts of the world are more receptive to Anime art style than others.  Today, I'm doing a comparison between the top 5 Anime style art games for the East vs. West.\nYTD 2022\nEast: $2.36B rev ÷ 24M download = $98  RpD\nvs.\nWest: $575M rev ÷ 15.15M download = $38 RpD\nThe East has magnitudes more powerful monetization mechanics and/or high spending behaviors.  The West clearly isn't keeping up with their eastern counterparts.  Though the top game in both regions (Fate/Grand Order) is the same, the RpD is $419 vs. $118.\nFirst come, first served.
