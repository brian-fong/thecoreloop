          "caption": "powered by AppMagic.rocks 😎\nAs promised, today, we're going to look at some of Apex Legends Mobile's comps: PUBG Mobile and Garena Free Fire.  Since May 2022 until now, PUBG pulled in $881M and Garena did $222M, when compared to Apex's $33M.  Unsurprisingly, the genre incumbents dominated Apex's numbers by multiple magnitudes.  What is surprising was that Apex seemed to have eaten market share away from Garena's more than PUBG's.  In percentage terms, Garena has lost more revenue as Apex entered the scene.  Rev per Download (RpD) basis for PUBG and Garena is at $6.63 and $1.84 respectively.  Recall that Apex is already clocking in at $1.00 RpD.  Apex's monetization engine is much better than Garena's and PUBG's when compared to their 6-month post-launch period.  Though, Apex did have the benefits of standing on the shoulders of giants and learning the best practices from PUBG & Garena's multi-year track records.\nMy Dashboard:\nhttps://appmagic.rocks/dashboards/631b65262048c?promoCode=6373c4a19d368\n(First Come, First Served.
