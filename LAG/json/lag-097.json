So I wanted to dig into the Korean publisher market to see whats going on.  The top 5 publishers are NCSoft, 37Games, Netmarble, Kakao Games Corp., and Com2uS.  In total for 2022, they generated $3.06B with 122M downloads.  Comparing these figures to yesterday's Finnish publishers, we see that SK publishers know how to crank up that monetization or more likely SK gamers are wiling to simply spend more.\n\nMy Dashboard:\nhttps://appmagic.rocks/dashboards/63744e545122a??promoCode=6373c4af4d57f\n\n(First Come, First Served.  The dashboard is available for the first few users.  Make sure you turn NOTIF on if you missed this one).\n\n",
