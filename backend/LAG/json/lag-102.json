With Microsoft's $69B bid and them saying the mobile division is the most attractive asset, I wanted to dive deeper.  So obviously, King's Candy Crush franchise is leading in terms of lifetime rev ($5.5B) and downloads (1.1B) but Activision's CoD Mobile ($1.1B / 383M) and Blizzard's Hearthstone ($976M / 95M) & Diablo Immortal ($164M / 17.5M) aren't too shabby either.  In aggregate, there's about $7.74B in lifetime rev and $2.0B YTD 2022.  Not bad, but is it worth the $69B bid?\n\nMy dashboard:\nhttps://appmagic.rocks/dashboards/637d91ac29f69?promoCode=6373c4a19d368\n\n(First Come, First Served.
