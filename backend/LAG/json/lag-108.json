          "caption": "powered by AppMagic.rocks 😎\n\nTIn 2022 we've seen Roblox acquire numerous retail brand partnerships from Gucci and Ralph Lauren to Nike. YTD, Roblox generated $777M with 170M downloads, roughly $4.50 per download — note that this is only their mobile app.  These revenue figures doesn't include the brand partnership revenue (if any).  Digital fashion is hitting the metaverse.  Haute couture is here and we're about it.  Roblox isn't the only example; platforms such as Fortnite also partnered with Balenciaga and Air Jordan.  The interesting point is that these collabs could be as superficial as cosmetic skins to full-blown in-game on-brand experiences. But are the brands going to continue experimenting/utilizing these platforms in the short-term or would they wanna own the whole user exp themselves?\n\n",
