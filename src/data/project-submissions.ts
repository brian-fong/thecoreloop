    story: `Hey TCL community, super excited to share with you guys about Sipher and why I’ve been bullish since their initial mint.

Sipher will be creating a compelling game world built for gamers by gamers, around the core philosophy of "casual to start, fun to play, hard to master”. While the actual gameplay details are not finalized, there are early screens of a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena gameplay as well as a co-op dungeon crawler.

The founder - Tin Nguyen, is an avid & passionate gamer founder who aptly takes on the role of Sipheria’s World Architect. Personally designing the game art and writing lore, he takes great care to bring to life his vision of an immersive world built for players to adventure. Along with this passion for NFT gaming and the metaverse, he understands that a fun game, lucrative incentives and consistent content releases are key to drive adoption and a sustainable game economy.

From the top-quality game graphics, and deep world lore to the community management skills on display, I have full confidence in the execution of the team and I personally can’t wait to experience the game!`
