    story: `Hey TCL community, super excited to share with you guys about Sipher and why I’ve been bullish since their initial mint.

Sipher will be creating a compelling game world built for gamers by gamers, around the core philosophy of "casual to start, fun to play, hard to master”. While the actual gameplay details are not finalized, there are early screens of a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena gameplay as well as a co-op dungeon crawler.

The founder - Tin Nguyen, is an avid & passionate gamer founder who aptly takes on the role of Sipheria’s World Architect. Personally designing the game art and writing lore, he takes great care to bring to life his vision of an immersive world built for players to adventure. Along with this passion for NFT gaming and the metaverse, he understands that a fun game, lucrative incentives and consistent content releases are key to drive adoption and a sustainable game economy.

From the top-quality game graphics, and deep world lore to the community management skills on display, I have full confidence in the execution of the team and I personally can’t wait to experience the game!`

    story: `Hey TCL community, 0xKapitalK here! Been a big fan of what Mark Otero and his team have been building for awhile and wanted to share with you my personal thoughts on why I’m excited for Legions & Legends under Azra Games.
    
    **High Probability for Success.** This is Otero’s 9th Collect & Combat RPG — this signals **low execution risk** in terms of game development and delivery.   As an ex-hedge fund professional, he understands markets — more particularly the unrelenting and brutal nature of markets.   Additionally, the **team has worked together successfully before** in the past.  This is a key element that a lot of other projects lack.
    
    **Founder-Genre Fit.**  Mark grew up playing the *correct* games and therefore was influenced by the appropriate ideals and values that align perfectly with crypto.  As a D&D cult player, he not only understood but experienced the **power of true ownership through physically — and emotionally — holding onto his own character sheet**.  
    
    **Genre fit.** Azra Games operates in a unique sliver of the RPG genre game design that matches the best with blockchain. Ownership is part of the product and gameplay experience.
    
    **Narrative & Storytelling**.  The key element to a game is the story.  Neel Upadhye is a world builder who was written & directed award-winning short films with world-class IPs like StarWars and Apex Legends.  He was also the Narrative lead for Battlefield 2042 and lead writer for Need for Speed.
    
    With all that being said, Legions & Legends is certainly one to look out for in the next era of web3 games`
