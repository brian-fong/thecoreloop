  subheading: `Top Fortnite creator, Ali "SypherPK" Hassan, created a live-service map on Fortnite islands using UEFN called Rocket Wars.  Within the first 30 days the island garnered 5M hours of playtime, 160k hours per day.  this playtime is similar to that of Among Us.

More importantly, this is a key example of user-generated content utilizing user-powered crosspromotions.
